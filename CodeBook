About R script:
Submitted R code file, "run_analysis.R", performs the 5 following steps (in accordance assigned task of course work):

1 - Reading in the files and merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  1.1 Reading files
  1.1.1 Reading trainings data
  1.1.2 Reading testing data
  1.1.3 Reading subject data
  1.1.4 Reading activity data
  1.1.5 Reading features data
  1.2 Assigning variable names: subject, activity and features
  1.3 Merging all data in one set: completeData
2 - Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  2.1 Create vector for defining ID, mean and standard deviation
  2.2 Making nessesary subset from merged data set
3 - Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  3.1 Change activity field in extractedData type from numeric to character
  3.2 Updated activity names in the activity variable
4 - Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
5 - Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
  5.1 Making second tidy data set
  5.2 Writing second tidy data set in txt file
The code assumes all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.
